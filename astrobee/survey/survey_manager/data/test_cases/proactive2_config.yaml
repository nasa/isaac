# Another test case for a robot proactively getting out of another robot's way.
# This time each robot has to get out of the other robot's way. First Honey
# should make way for higher-priority Bumble, then when Bumble is done with
# all of its goals, it should make way for Honey.

goals:

- {type: panorama, robot: bumble, order: 0, location: jem_bay3}

- {type: panorama, robot: honey, order: 0, location: jem_bay5}

init:
  bumble:
    location: jem_bay5
  honey:
    location: jem_bay3
