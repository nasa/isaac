# Test case for marking goals completed. For goals with completed: true, we should see completed-x
# and need-x predicates asserted in the problem_generator.py output, and those goals should not
# result in any actions in the plan. This is a fairly minimal test case verifying we can mark both
# panoramas and stereos as completed.

goals:

- {type: panorama, robot: bumble, order: 0, location: jem_bay4, completed: true}
- {type: panorama, robot: bumble, order: 1, location: jem_bay3}
- {type: stereo, robot: bumble, order: 4, trajectory: jem_bay1_to_bay3}

- {type: panorama, robot: honey, order: 1, location: jem_bay7, completed: true}
- {type: panorama, robot: honey, order: 2, location: jem_bay6}
- {type: stereo, robot: honey, order: 4, trajectory: jem_bay7_to_bay4, completed: true}
