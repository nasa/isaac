# Static configuration info used when generating a PDDL problem and also when executing actions in a
# PDDL plan. This info should be static in the sense that it nominally doesn't change during an ISS
# activity, so the survey manager doesn't have to modify it. However, an edge case is that an
# operator might want to manually edit something in here (like add a new symbolic location or nudge
# the position of a named bay away from an obstacle) and restart the survey manager. On the other
# hand, info that is *expected* to change as part of the survey manager conops belongs in
# jem_survey_dynamic.yaml.
