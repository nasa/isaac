# Second test case for marking goals completed. This case is a copy of the baseline problem instance
# to be used on ISS, but with the first few actions marked complete to simulate the system state if
# a replan is needed partway through execution. Let's simulate the state at t=~1700 seconds when
# each robot should have completed its first two panoramas.

goals:

- {type: panorama, robot: bumble, order: 0, location: jem_bay4, completed: true}
- {type: panorama, robot: bumble, order: 1, location: jem_bay3, completed: true}
- {type: panorama, robot: bumble, order: 2, location: jem_bay2}
- {type: panorama, robot: bumble, order: 3, location: jem_bay1}
- {type: stereo, robot: bumble, order: 4, trajectory: jem_bay1_to_bay3}
- {type: robot_at, robot: bumble, location: berth1}

- {type: panorama, robot: honey, order: 1, location: jem_bay7, completed: true}
