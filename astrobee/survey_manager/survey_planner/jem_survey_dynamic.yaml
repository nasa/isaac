# Example dynamic configuration info used when generating a PDDL problem.  For now, this is goal
# conditions and initial state. A likely conops is that the initial version of this file for a
# specific activity would be hand-generated, but it might later be automatically regenerated by the
# survey manager when a replan is needed (remove completed/failed goals, add retry goals, update
# initial state to match actual current state, etc.)  See also jem_survey_static.yaml.

goals:

- {type: panorama, robot: bumble, order: o0, location: jem_bay4, run: run1}
- {type: panorama, robot: bumble, order: o1, location: jem_bay3, run: run1}
- {type: panorama, robot: bumble, order: o2, location: jem_bay2, run: run1}
- {type: panorama, robot: bumble, order: o3, location: jem_bay1, run: run1}
- {type: stereo, robot: bumble, order: o4, trajectory: jem_bay1_to_bay3, run: run1}

# We want Bumble to return to its berth at the end of the run, but adding this goal causes POPF to
# get confused and greatly increase the total run time. For some reason, it doesn't notice it can
# use the same plan as without this goal and then add some motion actions at the end to achieve this
# goal. Instead, it falls back to only undocking one robot at a time, which slows things down by
# about 2x.
# - {type: robot_at, robot: bumble, location: berth1}

- {type: panorama, robot: honey, order: o0, location: jem_bay7, run: run1}
- {type: panorama, robot: honey, order: o1, location: jem_bay6, run: run1}
- {type: panorama, robot: honey, order: o2, location: jem_bay5, run: run1}

# This is another objective we want to include that for some reason causes POPF to fail to generate
# a plan (hang indefinitely). No obvious reason why it should cause a problem.
