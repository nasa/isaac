"""
This is a reference implementation for how to generate panorama orientations given a
configuration that includes the desired pan and tilt ranges, camera field of view,
desired overlap between consecutive images, and attitude tolerance to account
for the possibility of pointing error.

The main function of interest is panoOrientations(). There is also some
validation logic, and some of the test cases are candidates for the configurations to
test during ISAAC ISS activities.
