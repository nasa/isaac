# Test case for a robot proactively getting out of another robot's way. The first robot mentioned
# in the 'goals' section is considered the higher priority robot and the other robot should get
# out of its way in a conflict. In this problem, Bumble is the higher priority robot and it needs
# to go through Honey's current location to get to its desired pano location, so Honey should
# move to get out of its way.

goals:

# Note: The proactive move-out-of-the-way heuristic will fail causing a planner crash if Bumble's
# pano is requested in jem_bay7 because Honey arbitrarily chooses to get out of Bumble's way by
# moving to berth1, then Honey has nowhere to go to get out of Bumble's way when Bumble tries to
# move to berth1 afterward. We will probably not be able to fix that kind of case robustly because
# it would require a major overhaul of the deconflicting approach, making things considerably more
# complicated. Luckily, it seems unlikely to arise in practice.
