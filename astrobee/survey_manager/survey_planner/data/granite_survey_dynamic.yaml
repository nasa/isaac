# Example dynamic configuration info used when generating a PDDL problem.  For now, this is goal
# conditions and initial state. A likely conops is that the initial version of this file for a
# specific activity would be hand-generated, but it might later be automatically regenerated by the
# survey manager when a replan is needed (remove completed/failed goals, add retry goals, update
# initial state to match actual current state, etc.)  See also jem_survey_static.yaml.

goals:

- {type: panorama, robot: bsharp, order: 0, location: gra_bay2}
- {type: stereo, robot: bsharp, order: 1, trajectory: gra_bay1_to_bay3}
# This is one of the goals we previously had to comment out for POPF to return a halfway decent
# plan. Adding a let_other_robot_reach goal mostly fixed the problem.
- {type: robot_at, robot: bsharp, location: berth1}

# This let_other_robot_reach goal is effectively a very specific kind of between-robot ordering
# constraint. It tells honey to let bumble get to bay 5 before taking its first panorama. Without
# this constraint, POPF produces a very inefficient plan where bumble never leaves the dock until
# after honey finishes all its tasks and returns to dock. (It's safe to comment this out if the
# planner doesn't need the hint.)
# - {type: let_other_robot_reach, robot: honey, order: 0, location: jem_bay5}

- {type: panorama, robot: wannabee, order: 1, location: gra_bay6}
# This is the other objective we previously had to comment out for POPF to return a decent plan.
- {type: stereo, robot: wannabee, order: 4, trajectory: gra_bay5_to_bay7}
