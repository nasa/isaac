        ;; === Static predicates ===
        ;; move-connected: Indicates a robot can travel from ?from to ?to using a single
        ;; move action. Note that these are interpreted as directed links, so for the usual case
        ;; that you can travel in either direction, you must assert the predicate both ways.
        ;; Neither location can be a berth (use the dock-connected predicate for that). However,
        ;; both bays 6 and 7 should be move-connected to both berth approach points.
        (move-connected ?from ?to - location)

        ;; location-real: Indicates a location is a real place the robot can fly to. We've added
        ;; bogus locations bay0 and bay8 to the problem instance to satisfy the implicit assumption
        ;; of the collision checking that every bay has two neighbors. We assert location-real for
        ;; the other locations and use it as a precondition on moves so the planner can't
        ;; accidentally fly to a bogus location.
        (location-real ?location - location)

        ;; dock-connected: Indicates a robot can move from ?approach to ?berth using a dock
        ;; action, or from ?berth to ?approach using an undock action.
        (dock-connected ?approach ?berth - location)

        ;; robots-different: Indicates a != b. Needs to be expressed as a positive predicate
        ;; so it can be used as a precondition. Must be asserted in both directions.
        (robots-different ?a ?b - robot)

        ;; locations-different: Indicates a != b. Needs to be expressed as a positive predicate
        ;; so it can be used as a precondition. Must be asserted in both directions.
        (locations-different ?a ?b - location)

        ;; === Dynamic predicates ===
        ;; robot-available: Since a robot can only perform one action at a time in our domain, each
        ;; action grabs this mutex. In the initial state, both robots should be available.
        (robot-available ?robot - robot)

        ;; robot-at: Indicates the robot's current position (usually not set during execution of
        ;; motion actions). In the initial state, both robots should have robot-at set for their
        ;; initial locations.
        (robot-at ?robot - robot ?location - location)

        ;; location-available: Indicates that no robot has reserved the location. When stationary,
        ;; each robot reserves its current location. During a move, it reserves both its ?from
        ;; location and its ?to location. Collision avoidance checks prevent robots from reserving
        ;; the same location or reserving adjacent bays while flying. Note: It might be more natural
        ;; to express this as a location-reserved predicate with the opposite boolean sense, but we
        ;; need it to be this way so we can use it as a precondition without negating it.  In the
        ;; initial state, we must mark location-available for all locations, real or bogus, except
        ;; the initial robot locations.
        (location-available ?location - location)

        ;; need-stereo: If you add a completed-stereo goal, you must also add a need-stereo
        ;; predicate with identical parameters to the initial state. This is part of a hack that
        ;; greatly improves planner performance. The need-stereo predicate has been made part of the
        ;; preconditions of the stereo action, and one of its effects is to clear the
        ;; predicate. Therefore, the planner won't waste time trying to execute stereo actions that
        ;; the user didn't explicitly request. Without this hack, the planner run time blows up.

        ;; panorama. For now, goals specify ?robot and ?order parameters that constrain
        ;; multi-robot task allocation and task ordering.

        ;; survey. For now, goals specify ?robot and ?order parameters that constrain multi-robot
        ;; task allocation and task ordering. The current model for stereo surveys assumes the robot
        ;; starts and ends the survey at the same location called ?base (these locations only need
        ;; to be same to the effective precision modeled in the planner, "less than a bay apart").
        ;; The ?bound argument indicates the other end of the interval covered by the survey and is
        ;; used for collision checking. It's assumed that ?base and ?bound are not adjacent
        ;; locations. If future stereo surveys violate these assumptions the model will need to be
