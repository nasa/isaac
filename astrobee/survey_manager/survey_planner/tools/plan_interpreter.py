"""
Provides an example of how to interpret the actions in a survey domain plan, dropping the irrelevant
arguments, mapping the positional arguments back to the names used in the dynamic config, and
looking up extra info that's not needed by the planner but is important for execution (e.g.,
coordinates of named locations, fplan filenames of stereo surveys).

For testing, you can call this from the command line on a complete sample output plan.

For use during execution, if you are receiving one action at a time from an executor, you may
prefer to import this module and call the yaml_action_from_pddl() function directly.
