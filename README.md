The ISAAC project has three main technical thrusts:

1. **Integrated data**: The current state of the art is that data from sensors associated with different facility
   subsystems (Structures, GN&C, and ECLSS, etc.) remain siloed. ISAAC technology unifies facility data and models with
   autonomous robotics, linking data streams from facility subsystems, sensor networks, and robots, as well as linking 3D
   geometry and sensor data map layers, and detecting changes and anomalies.
2. **Integrated control interface**: Current state of the art manages facilities with largely independent interface tools
   for different subsystems. Interfaces have different heritage, design assumptions and operator interface styles. Subsystem
   interactions are hard to analyze due to poor connectivity between separate tools. ISAAC technology combines interface
   tools for facility subsystems and autonomous robots; improves system-level situation awareness, situation understanding,
   and operator productivity; enables linking and embedding between tools to improve subsystem interaction analysis; and
   supports the entire activity life cycle from planning through execution and analysis.
3. **Coordinated execution**: The current state of the art for executing facility activities that require coordination
   between subsystems is either manual commanding (operator tracks dependencies between subsystems) or simple sequencing
   that can be brittle to even minor contingencies during execution. ISAAC technology models dependencies, uses automated
   planning to translate a high-level task definition to a plan that can work given the current system state (e.g. include
   actions to open hatches so that a robot can move where needed), and leverages ISAACâ€™s integrated data technology to
   watch for execution contingencies and trigger replanning as needed. This technology will reduce the time to effect
   changes on the system during critical faults and emergencies.

This `isaac` repo serves as a master for integrating an end-to-end
demo that draws on code from the other repos as well as directly
including a significant amount of the ISAAC code, mostly relating to
the [Astrobee robot](https://github.com/nasa/astrobee). This repository includes:

- [Astrobee software](https://nasa.github.io/isaac/html/astrobee.html) for added behaviors such as inpection and cargo transport as well as new sensor utilization.
- [Dense mapping](https://nasa.github.io/isaac/html/geometric_streaming_mapper.html) to create a textured 3D map
- [Volumetric mapping](https://nasa.github.io/isaac/html/volumetric_mapper.html) to map volumetric signals, such as WiFi.
- [Image analysis](https://nasa.github.io/isaac/html/ano.html) module to train a neural network to detect anomalies

You may also be interested in the separate repository for the [ISAAC User Interface](https://github.com/nasa/isaac_user_interface),
which enables monitoring of multiple robots through a web browser.

System requirements
---------

The `isaac` repo depends on the `astrobee` repo, therefore it inherits
the same system requirements. You must use Ubuntu 16.04 to 20.04 64-bit. When
running in simulation, certain Gazebo plugins require appropriate
graphics drivers. See INSTALL.md in that repository for more
information.

Usage
---------

There are two main ways to install and run `isaac`:

1. For development: Build the `isaac` code on your native Ubuntu OS (or
   inside a normal virtual machine) in a way that makes it convenient
   for you to edit and incrementally recompile.

2. For demo: For the ISAAC integrated demo, many ISAAC repos are
   checked out, built, and run in a distributed fashion across
   multiple docker containers. The `isaac` code itself is built and
   run inside one of these containers. Note that the in-docker build
   is managed by the Dockerfile and completely separate from any build
   in your native OS, and you don't need to install for development
   prior to installing for demo.
