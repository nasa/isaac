# Another test case for a robot proactively getting out of another robot's way.  This time Honey
# needs to wait to start its stereo survey because it would interfere with Bumble's higher-priority
# panorama. (Honestly, this behavior is kind of dumb, but it's the correct behavior per the
# deconflicting heuristic.)

goals:

- {type: panorama, robot: bumble, order: 0, location: jem_bay3}

- {type: stereo, robot: honey, order: 0, trajectory: jem_bay1_to_bay3}

init:
  bumble:
    location: berth1
  honey:
    location: jem_bay2
